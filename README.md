# ThesisPresentations
Source of several LaTeX presentations I made from the Feather beamer theme.

- AcTinG: a P2P gossip protocol (content-sharing) that detects and prevents selfish behaviors (nodes that avoid to share with others the content they ought to)

- PAG: a P2P gossip protocol that deters individual selfish behaviors while protecting the privacy of interactions, and interests, using cryptographic mechanisms.
